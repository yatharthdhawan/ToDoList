**About project**
<!-- -I have made a todolist using  HTML,CSS,JavaScript in which i have appended the li (or the to do items) with the help of JS. Moreover, i have added features like - checking the task, deletion of task.  -->

<!-- -With the help of the concept of object creation i have created object **task** which has id, boolean(true/false for completed or not) and text attached to it. -->

<!-- -Added event listener to the input box as well as event listener to detect click on the whole document for deleting/checking/adding the task. -->
